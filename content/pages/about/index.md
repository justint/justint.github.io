I'm **Justin (he/him/his)**, a Technical Director at [Walt Disney Animation Studios](https://disneyanimation.com/). I work on our studio's animation pipeline and help craft the tools our artists use.

I've worked on films such as [_Frozen 2_](@/projects/frozen2/index.md), [_Raya and the Last Dragon_](@/projects/raya/index.md), and _Encanto_ (2021).
