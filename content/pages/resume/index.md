My San Jose State University student reel from 2017 ([direct link](https://vimeo.com/239400372)). It features two projects:

- My [real-time, markerless, single-camera facial motion capture system ("Stringless")](@/projects/stringless/index.md).
  
- An animation pose library for saving, loading, and sharing character poses in Autodesk Maya, co-developed at [Rig Think](https://rigthink.com/). 

For more recent work, check out my [projects](@/projects/_index.md).
