A brand new website is born! 
<!-- more -->

The year is now 2022, and I've finally redone my website! 

Please browse around and check out all the projects. I'm particularly proud of these few:

 - [_Raya and the Last Dragon_](@/projects/raya/index.md), for the interactive before/after sliders
 - [papaya](@/projects/papaya/index.md), the theme I developed for this site 
 - [My About page](@/pages/about/index.md), which includes fun facts about me!!!

It has been a long and arduous journey to get to where it is now. In the coming days I'll put up a new post detailing my reasonings for using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) as the site's static generation system.

If ya like what ya see, <a href="mailto:me@justintennant.me?subject=Your website is cool">drop me a message</a>!
