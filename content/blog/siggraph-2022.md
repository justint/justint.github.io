It's [SIGGRAPH](https://s2022.siggraph.org/) time! ðŸŽ‰

I'll be attending the conference in person for the week. It's the first time the conference has been hosted in person since 2019, and I'm especially excited to be returning to the beautiful Vancouver city.

I'm also thrilled to be presenting our metrics visualization work we did on _Encanto_:

> Walt Disney Animation Studios presents the Command Center, a web application for communicating and monitoring high-dimensional production metrics at the studio. Developed during the production of _Encanto_, the Command Center provides near-real-time insights into key film production metrics, all integrated into a singular novel film interface.

Our studio has a bunch of presentations this year at SIGGRAPH (can't get enough _Encanto_!):
