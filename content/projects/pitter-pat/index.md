# Reviews

Awarded "**Host's Choice**" for the [ðŸ’€ SCREAM JAM 2020 ðŸ’€](https://itch.io/jam/scream-jam-2020)! 

Rave reviews by other jam developers:

> Very interesting and very unsettling game. I came in with few questions and I came out with more. I need more. 5/5  -- srg

> This game is perfect. Honestly there's not a single thing to dock points for. The art is absolutely on point. -- makegamergirls

> This is extremely good considering the time you had to make it in, and one thing I certainly wasn't expecting to find was a horror parody of one of my favorite [Humongous Games] series. -- Attica Kish

# Development

Developed specifically for the [ðŸ’€ SCREAM JAM 2020 ðŸ’€](https://itch.io/jam/scream-jam-2020) game jam on itch.io. Co-developed with the same friend who I also worked on [Horai](@/projects/horai/index.md) with together!

Built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), using the [Escoria 2.0 point-and-click adventure game framework](https://github.com/godot-escoria/escoria-demo-game/tree/esc2-godot3.2).

# Music

I also wrote the soundtrack!

<div style="width: 70%; margin: auto; padding: 10px 0">
Museum: <audio src="museum_theme.mp3" preload="metadata" controls loop style="width:80%; float: right"></audio>

End: <audio src="end_theme.mp3" preload="metadata" controls loop style="width:80%; float: right"></audio>
</div>

To get those classic mid-90's synthesized instrument sounds, I emulated the Yamaha YMF262 chip ([utilized in multiple sound cards in the day](http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=YMF262)) using the [ADLplug chip synthesizer](https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug). 

While I was playing around with that synthesizer, I discovered quite a few instruments I recognized from some early Humongous Entertainment games (Putt-Putt, Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise), especially the soundtracks produced by [Tom McMail](http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php/Tom_McMail). I might later write a blog post dissecting each game's music and what synth instruments were used, a-la [Reverb Machine](https://reverbmachine.com/)!
