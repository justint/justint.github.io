DanceHack is a web app that uses [OpenPose motion detection](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) and a video cam to detect the dancing motions of people and chooses an appropriate song to play using the Spotify API.

This SB Hacks 2018 hackathon project won Best Modern C++ by Toyon Research Corporation!

See the [DanceHack website](https://justintennant.me/dance-hack/) for video demonstrations and a detailed technical breakdown.
