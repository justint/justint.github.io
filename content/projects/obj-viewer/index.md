A very simple single file OBJ file viewer, written in C++ using OpenGL and GLUT.

I wrote this in my Introduction to Computer Graphics class at San Jose State University.

Use the arrow keys to move the camera around/zoom in. Press `w` to enable wireframe render mode, and `s` to switch back to the single light diffuse + specular light render mode.

I threw in the classic Stanford bunny file for demonstration purposes, but most other simple OBJ files should work. If you find an OBJ file that breaks my code, let me know so I can improve it!
