I'm proud to have presented my team's work on _Encanto_ at SIGGRAPH 2022 in Vancouver, Canada:

> [**Visualizing the Production Process of _Encanto_ With the Command Center**](https://s2022.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_205&sess=sess138)
> 
> Walt Disney Animation Studios presents the Command Center, a web application for communicating and monitoring high-dimensional production metrics at the studio. Developed during the production of _Encanto_, the Command Center provides near-real-time insights into key film production metrics, all integrated into a singular novel film interface.
