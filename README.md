# justint.github.io

This is my website at [justintennant.me](justintennant.me).

It's built using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site engine, with the [Papaya](https://github.com/justint/papaya) theme.

If you'd like to use my website's styling and theme, please refer to the [Installation](https://github.com/justint/papaya#installation) instructions for Papaya. **Don't just fork/copy**: there are specific things in here developed just for this site alone, including tracking, special Zola shortcodes, etc. Unless you're suggesting changes or fixing spelling errors, then that's okay :)
